- 👋  Hi, I’m @cchsing-ntu
- 📝  I am using this account to record things I've done during my Master's at National Taiwan Unversity.
- 🧠  I studied at the Graduate Institute of Brain and Mind Science from August 2019 ~ February 2022.
- 💼  I am still working here at the [Brain and Mind Laboratory](http://gibms.mc.ntu.edu.tw/bmlab/) as a research assistant starting from March 2022.
- 🤓  I write mostly in MATLAB, but I'm also learning other languages (LaTeX, R, Git, Python ...) as well.
- 📫  Find me at *r08454015 [at] ntu.edu.tw* if you want to get in touch!
